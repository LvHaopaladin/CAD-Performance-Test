# CAD-Performance-Test

This tool is designed for evaluating the performance of 3D CAD software. It helps CAD software developers identify the performance gap between their products and industry-leading solutions. Additionally, it assists software users in selecting the most suitable CAD software for their needs. 
The tool also integrates functionality evaluation, which will be introduced in future updates.

## Download Files

To facilitate the direct reproduction of the Case Study, we have placed the testing tools, test cases, and several CAD software packages in a virtual machine. Due to file size limitations, the files have been split into multiple parts and stored in a cloud drive. The download instructions can be found in the `How to download.txt` file. We are continuously looking for more convenient download methods, and any updates will be posted in this file.

## Running the Virtual Machine

After extracting all the compressed files into the same folder, use VMware to run the `Windows 7 x64.vmdk` file. VMware version 17.6.0 has been tested and works successfully.
